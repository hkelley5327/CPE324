This is a repository of my work during the Spring 2026 semester in CPE324 (Adv. Digitial Logic Design Lab).
Each lab folder contains the assignment, a pdf lab report, and any supplemental resources or images used to conceptualize the project or add context to the report. Some of these extra materials include PowerPoints developed by Dr. Buren Wells, the instructor for the course. I do not own these PowerPoints and all copyright belongs to Dr. Wells.

Some Verilog assingments given in CPE322, the companion class to the lab, are also included in the repo as I did not have another place to put them. These include any homeworks and simulations assigned in CPE322.
