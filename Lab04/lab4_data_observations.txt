Phase 1:
1uF cap measured at 0.996 micro Farads (put % error in report)
10 kOhm precision resistor measured at 9999.2 kOhm (put % error in report)
expected time at logic low (using derivation in pptx) = 6.903E-3 (redo math with measured resistor value instead of ideal value)
actual time at logic low = -width from oscope picture

Phase 2:
show how to find the number of clock cycles the waveform stays at 0 (cap discharge cycle)
cap discharge cycles = 3465.5 = full_count = 6931*0.01uF*50MHz
buswidth= ceil(log2(full_count)) = 12

Phase 3:
include BCD counter code in report

Phase 4:
include debounce function code in report
